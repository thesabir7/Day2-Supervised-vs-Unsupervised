# Day2-Supervised-vs-Unsupervised
# 📘 Day 2: Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

Today, I revisited the core concepts of Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning, with hands-on implementation using `scikit-learn`.

## 🔍 Concepts Covered

### 🔹 Supervised Learning
- Uses **labeled** data
- Common algorithms:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
- Example task: Classification on Iris dataset

### 🔹 Unsupervised Learning
- Uses **unlabeled** data
- Common algorithms:
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Example task: Clustering on Iris dataset

## 🧠 Key Learning

> Choosing the right algorithm depends heavily on your dataset type and the business problem you're solving.

## 💻 Project

I built a simple **classifier** using the **Iris dataset** (Supervised Learning).  
Additionally, I explored **K-Means Clustering** (Unsupervised Learning) for comparison.

## 📁 Files Included

- `supervised_classifier.py` - Train/test a Decision Tree on the Iris dataset
- `unsupervised_clustering.py` - Apply K-Means to cluster the Iris dataset
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python supervised_classifier.py
python unsupervised_clustering.py
